### Hello there, I'm Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning new technologies and languages. With time I've learned that knowing multiple languages and following their communities and better practices help me to further my knowledge and experience. I like to apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. :computer:
